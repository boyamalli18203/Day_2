why index start with 0,string upper, lower, array static and dynamic array .where we have to use list
Why index starts with 0.

 ** computer can identfiy the memory address of the element,first element should be 0,because of the we need to add another element to the array 1.
 ** String  is data type we can store the text, so many methods are in string, like   UPPER(),LOWER(),COUNT(), etc.
 ARRAY:
  what is array??
   ** array can store the  multiple elements with single variable.
   ** In array can store the values based on the index.
   ** Array can be static and dyanmic of the size.
   ** Static means size of the array is fixed, not growable  at run time
   ** Array can  store the only homogeneous elements. can't store the heterogenous elements.
   ** In Array we can  add the elements using the method this method is var.appened("ueo"), var.pop("ueo"), var.clear("ueo"), var.sort(), var.revese(),var.remove("mall"),
   ** We identify the  no.of elements in the array ,, using the length method, len().
   eg:: 
   cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
   

   

   List::
     ** List is most verstailed data type in python,.
     ** list is ennhance of the array
     ** list can store the heterogeous data type, and homegenous data.
     ** The size of the list can be changed dynamically.
     ** List can store the values in ordered,changable,allow the duplicates,
     eg::
     cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW",8,'7'," ","", 8]


     where we can use the list??
      ** we need to store the age of 5 students, instead of creating 5 separate variables, we can simply create a list
      ** Some real-world examples of using lists include:Storing a list of customers for a businessKeeping track of a list 
        of items in a shopping cartStoring a list of tasks in a to-do list application

      ** In organisation store the employee details like employeeId,employeeName,EmployeeDignation,EmployeeAdress etc.
