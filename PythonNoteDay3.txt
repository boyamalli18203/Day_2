variable,String is immuatable,why immutables,list,

VARIABLE NAMING CONVENTION IN PYTHON
** Variable name must and shoulb be starts with Letters or underscore Charcter(_)
** variable name should not starts with numericals
** variavle name should not starts with special charcters like (*&^%#@!<><?)
** While wrriting the variable name must should follow the camel Case (produOfTwoNumbers).
** A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
** A Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
** A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
eg:
x=10,
_c=3
m_v="890"


String:

String is sequence of the Characters,or txt format wrrite in double or single quoets.
a="Tom and Jerry"

String methods:
a.lower()
a.upper()
a.count()
a.reverse()
a.strip() remove the space starting and ending of the string.
a.replace()
a.remove()
a.split() 

Why Immutable in programing language??
## immutable objects can be useful in multi-threaded applications. Multiple threads can act on data represented
   by immutable objects without concern of the data being changed by other threads.
## Immutable objects are therefore considered more thread-safe than mutable objects.
** thread safity,security, avoid the ombiguity etc.

What is immutable??
** Immutable means we can't change or modify or update the value of string
** We can change the value of the String  create the object then only change or update the value
eg:
 String is immutable 
  name="malli"
   name="Karjuna"
print(name)
name= name+" "+name
print(name)


 What is mutable??
** Mutable means we can easly modify the value without creating the object.

List
  ** List can store the heterogenous elments and homegenous elements
  ** List can store the values based on the index
  ** List allow the duplicate values
  ** no need to mention the data type of list 
  ** in python every variable is object.

eg:: fridege,employee details, cart page,Books,
methods in list
eg:num=[8,8.485,38,48,'ueor',"ieoeo"]
len(num)
num.count(38)
num.appdend("malli")
num.pop()
num.pop(8)
num.remove("malli")
reverse(num)
what is Homegenous??
 we have to store the same elements, similar values can store.
eg :: int num=[8,8.485,38,48]
      Str txs=["Ma","Ra",'Ja']

what is heterogenous??
we have store teh different elements,the comibination of the numurial, alphabitical,

eg ::  num=[8,8.485,38,48,'ueor',"ieoeo"]
      txs=["Ma","Ra",'Ja']
