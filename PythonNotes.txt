*  PYTHON BOOT CAMP**

1.What is python??
  @@ Python is hight level,interpreted language and Dynamic Typed programming language, object oriented programming language.

  **High level language is programming language desinged simplfy to computer programming language and make easy to access to humans.
  **Interpreted language is programming language designed to exute the code line by line.
  **Dynamic Typed Programming language , when we declaration, initialisation of varialbles no need to mention the data type,at the run  time will take .


VARIABLE 

     ** variable is a container the store the values, identify the values single variablem,represents the address of the variavle where we have to store value.
   x=10;
   y="mallikarungkkn";
   z='i';

Data Types: It is represents the kind of the  value to store , what kind of operations to perform the data types 

     1.Numeric __ int,flaot
     2.Boolean __ bool
     3.Sequence __ list,tuple,range
     4.set      __ set
     5.Text    __ str


TYPE CONVERSION
     It represents the one data type to another data type is called type conversion. int().float(),complex(),

    eg: x=1,y="mal",z=10+j;
     convert int to float, and complex
   
    d=float(x);
    e=complex(x);
